# Project Bluebean Agent Handoff

This repo is a Godot 4.6.3 first-person, round-based fantasy survival shooter. The git root is
`C:\Users\sith\Code\projectbluebean`; the actual Godot project is nested at
`C:\Users\sith\Code\projectbluebean\projectbluebean` (`res://`).

## Current State

The game is playable through the main scene, `res://scenes/world/Arena.tscn`.

Completed and committed so far:

- Core loop, economy, interactables, wall-buy Staff, buyable door, player health, and HUD.
- Imported goblin/orc enemy model with animation.
- Fixed goblin hit detection by resizing the `Orc.tscn` capsule collider.
- Wired KayKit Crossbow and Staff view models.
- Added discrete round/wave system with round UI and between-round breather.
- Added weapon slots: Crossbow on `1`, Staff on `2` once purchased.
- Added quick melee on `V` so the player has a fallback when out of ammo.
- Added Fire Staff projectile bolts.
- Added HUD weapon feedback: hit marker on confirmed damage and `Reloading` text during reload.

Recent commits:

- `dfd4c30 Add weapon hit and reload feedback`
- `d9905c7 Add Fire Staff projectile bolts`
- `e75c70a Add weapon slots and melee fallback`
- `7a76921 Add round wave system`
- `2751734 Use KayKit weapon view models`
- `6620e90 Fix goblin hit detection`

## Verification Notes

Use Godot MCP with the editor running:

- Run main scene with `project_run(mode="main", autosave=false)`.
- Confirm `editor_state` reports `game_capture_ready: true`.
- Use `editor_manage game_eval` for deterministic runtime checks.
- Stop play sessions with `project_manage(op="stop")` when done.

Verified most recently:

- Crossbow hit reduced enemy health `100 -> 55`.
- Fire Staff uses projectile bolts and damages after travel.
- Melee hit reduced enemy health `100 -> 45`.
- Crossbow reload HUD shows `Reloading`, then returns to ammo text.
- Hit marker appears on confirmed Crossbow/projectile/melee damage and clears after its flash.
- Weapon switching and Staff re-buy/refill work without duplicating slots.
- Round 1 and Round 2 scheduling work.

Known recurring warning:

- `Property agent_height is ceiled to cell_height voxel units and loses precision`
  from `scripts/systems/arena.gd:_bake_navigation`. This existed before the latest work and is
  not currently blocking gameplay.

Known git/sandbox quirk:

- `git status` may print Windows permission warnings for `C:\Users\sith/.config/git/ignore`.
  The repo can still be clean. Git staging/commits may require escalated permission because the
  sandbox cannot write `.git/index.lock`.

## Important Paths

- Main scene: `projectbluebean/scenes/world/Arena.tscn`
- Player: `projectbluebean/scripts/player/player.gd`
- Weapon logic: `projectbluebean/scripts/weapons/weapon.gd`
- Weapon data: `projectbluebean/resources/weapons/*.tres`
- Fire bolt: `projectbluebean/scripts/weapons/fire_bolt.gd`,
  `projectbluebean/scenes/weapons/FireBolt.tscn`
- HUD: `projectbluebean/scripts/ui/hud.gd`, `projectbluebean/scenes/ui/HUD.tscn`
- Round system: `projectbluebean/scripts/systems/arena.gd`
- Enemy: `projectbluebean/scripts/enemies/orc.gd`, `projectbluebean/scenes/enemies/Orc.tscn`

## Best Next Step

Continue M3 weapon polish.

Recommended next task: add a simple reload animation / weapon handling feedback. The user noted
there is no reload animation and the Crossbow hangs in the air, but aim is not blocked. A small
procedural reload motion in `weapon.gd` or per-weapon scene transforms is probably the fastest
high-value improvement.

Other good next tasks:

- Add Staff/Crossbow firing and reload SFX.
- Add stronger projectile impact particles/light.
- Add the KayKit throwing axe as a third weapon or throwable.
- Add ammo pickup/refill affordances if ammo scarcity feels too punishing.
- Start M4 with a simple Mystery Box or perk shrine once M3 feel is satisfying.

## User Preferences / Context

The user can manually playtest when asked. They care about practical feel and are comfortable
iterating through Godot MCP. Keep changes scoped and commit verified checkpoints.
